To run WonkeyKong:

1. Locate the folder WonkeyKongSample, which should have in it files named
WonkeyKong and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/WonkeyKongSample or /Users/yourname/Downloads/WonkeyKongSample.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the
WonkeyKongSample folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the WonkeyKong executable.

4. Type
        ./WonkeyKong
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder WonkeyKong, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the WonkeyKong executable
file.
